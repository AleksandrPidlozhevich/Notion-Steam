+ Connecting the database in Notion  
Next, your task is to go to the Notion page and add access to it. This is done quite simply:  
We go to the database page. Important: it must be exactly Database - full page  
In the upper right corner there will be ... you need to click on them and go to the "Add connections" section.

Then we add our token.  
It is important to note that the token is bound not only to the datebase itself, but also to all child pages of this datebase.  
After that, we need to copy our database page code.  
We go to the page url and copy everything after https://www.notion.so/ and before ?v. This is the code for our Database.
